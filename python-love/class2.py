# write a  progragram that returns Fizz if a number is divisible by 3
# if the number is divisible by Buzz
# if the number is divible by 3 and 5 FizzBuzz
# Problem
#   if the number is divisble by 3 return Fizz
#   if number is divisble by 5 return Buzz
#   if number is divisble by 3 and 5 return FizzBuzz
# Example Ouput:
    # 15 --> FizzBuzz
    # 10 --> Buzz
    # 9 --> Fizz
# Data:
    # strings (input)
    # boolean
    # float/integer
# Algorithm
    # Write a helper function called fizzbuzz, that ask the user for an input (num) and
    # convert it to a integer or float
def fizzbuzz():
    # num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    num = input('Enter a numebr: ')
    num = int(num) # converts the input string to integer
    # if num is divisible by 3 and 5 print 'FizzBuzz'
    if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    # if num is divisble by 3 print 'Fizz'
    elif num % 3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    # if num is divisible by 5 print 'Buzz'
    elif num % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(f'{num} is not divible by 3 or 5')

fizzbuzz()

# get number from the user
















# num1 = input('Enter a number: ')
# num2 = input('Enter another numebr: ')

# if num1 == num2:
#     print(f'{num1} is greater than {num2}')
# elif num1 < num2:
#     print(f'{num1} is less than {num2}')
# else:
#     print(f'{num1} is greater than {num2}')
