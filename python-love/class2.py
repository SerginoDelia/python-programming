# write a  progragram that returns Fizz if a number is divisible by 3
# if the number is divisible by Buzz
# if the number is divible by 3 and 5 FizzBuzz
# Problem
#   if the number is divisble by 3 return Fizz
#   if number is divisble by 5 return Buzz
#   if number is divisble by 3 and 5 return FizzBuzz
# Example Ouput:
    # 15 --> FizzBuzz
    # 10 --> Buzz
    # 9 --> Fizz
# Data:
    # strings (input)
    # boolean
    # float/integer
# Algorithm
    # Write a helper function called fizzbuzz, that ask the user for an input (num) and
    # convert it to a integer or float
# def fizzbuzz():
#     # num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
#     num = input('Enter a numebr: ')
#     num = int(num) # converts the input string to integer
#     # if num is divisible by 3 and 5 print 'FizzBuzz'
#     if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
#         print('FizzBuzz')
#     # if num is divisble by 3 print 'Fizz'
#     elif num % 3 == 0:
#         print('Fizz')
#     # if num is divisible by 5 print 'Buzz'
#     elif num % 5 == 0:
#         print('Buzz')
#     else:
#         print(f'{num} is not divible by 3 or 5')

# fizzbuzz()

# get number from the user



















# num1 = input('Enter a number: ')
# num2 = input('Enter another numebr: ')

# if num1 == num2:
#     print(f'{num1} is greater than {num2}')
# elif num1 < num2:
#     print(f'{num1} is less than {num2}')
# else:
#     print(f'{num1} is greater than {num2}')
