# Arrays, takes less memory than lists and perform little faster
# when dealing with a large sequene of arrays and ecounter performance problems
# to use an array we need to import it
form array import array

# array and typecode
# arrays are typed, every items in the array below are integers
numbers = array("i", [1, 2, 3])

# can use list methods on the array
numbers.append(4) # to append a number at the end of the list
